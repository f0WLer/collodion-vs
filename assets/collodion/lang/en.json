With collodion covering the plate, the silvering solution can bind to it, sensitizing the plate to light.\n\n3) Load & Expose\n• With a silvered plate in your offhand, hold the camera and use <hk>shift</hk> + <icon>rightmousebutton</icon> to load the plate into it.\n• Once you're ready to take a photograph, look through the viewfinder <icon>rightmousebutton</icon> and use <icon>leftmousebutton</icon> to expose the plate to light.\n• Unload the camera the same way to get your new<a href=\"handbook://item-collodion:exposedplate\">exposed plate</a>. There's still work to do before you can see how it came out.\n\n4) Develop & Fix\n• Place the exposed plate in your development tray.\n• As you pour developer onto the plate, you should begin to see the image.\n• Finish the process by pouring on fixer to stabilize the plate as a <a href=\"handbook://item-collodion:finishedphotoplate\">finished photo plate</a>.\n\n4) Display\n• Mount your finished plate in a <a href=\"handbook://item-collodion:framedphotograph\">frame</a> and hang it on your wall to display your work!\n• Click on the frame with a wooden board to change the frame's material.\n• You can use writing materials like charcoal to add notes/captions to the photograph."
